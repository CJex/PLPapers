# Matthias's List for New or Aspiring PhD Students

What and Why
------------

Over the course of your first few couple of years as PhD student, you must
read some of the papers that shaped your advisor's mental image of the
research landscape---in addition to the papers that your group has
published on the relevant topic (in the widest sense). If you decide to
work on one of projects your advisor proposes, these readings equip you
with the proper background and help you shape your impressions of what is
going on. If you decide to bring something new to your advisor's world, you
still need to know how to approach him, how to communicate your ideas
effectively. The key to effective communication is to know how your advisor
thinks and why he thinks so.

I have classified the paper into those categories that are near and dear to
my heart. I don't *love* these papers, some I loathe for their lack of
precision, acknowledgment of historical debt, or sloppy writing.
Nevertheless, they left an impression, so they have somehow become a part
of the group's vocabulary. In addition, learning to distinguish good papers
from "must read even though I dislike them" papers may help you develop
your own taste. 

**Note** A paper on this list may not be not essential to your dissertation
research. It is unlikely to introduce you to modern ways of dealing with my
topics of interest. It is unlikely to be fashionable. It is improbable that
you will cite it in your dissertation. But, I consider the paper worth your
while; reading it is good for your soul.
